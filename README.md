## Build by DIFY filosofy (sticky elevator prhase)

Get close to localhost far away for any cloud
## Getting started
For staying far away and mantain own data in a secure manner first need to start with dev env. Make sure that API_GNX_KEY by now just for developer enviroments. If you run own node be sure place your own key.
``` bash
#or with i {before(str Cloud), '|| (or) similar with doble u.'} double 🫵
echo $(API_GNX_KEY) 2>&1 | gnx stream
```

For being more punctual about it and taking getting started like pro, first steps run in your shell bash
``` bash
gnx status daily # get status or next steps will print
```
### Satrting service
``` bash
# by example suggested --dev -p 8544
gnx start daily
```

## Welcome to the daily.dev.gnx
### Repository DIFY version 
Where the coffee's strong and the deadlines are even stronger.

We get it. Being a developer is like wrestling a greased octopus blindfolded. But it doesn't have to be a constant existential crisis. daily.dev.gnx is here to be your developer-shaped life raft in a sea of Stack Overflow despair. Personalized news, communities that actually listen, and a search function that doesn't just return 10,000 results for "undefined is not a function." Maybe. 😉

🔜 (Shields of Glory (or, at least, mildly impressive statistics))

Help your fellow developers avoid the fiery pits of despair. Share the (slightly less painful) daily.dev.gnx. experience.

### Forget daily standup meeting for ever maybe.

💜 About daily.dev.gnx Dify version (Because even cynical developers need a little love)
A professional network for developers. Because sometimes, you just need to commiserate with your people. 👩‍💻

We're not saying daily.dev.gnx is the answer to all your developer woes (though, wouldn't that be nice?), but it's a pretty good start. Discover knowledge, build communities, and discuss the latest trends – all without sacrificing your precious weekend. It even works offline! (Because let's face it, your internet connection is probably more unreliable than your code sometimes.)

Star us. It'll make us feel better about the existential dread of coding. ⭐️

📌 Get daily.dev.gnx (because downloading things is way easier than writing code)
We're on Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and even mobile. Because we love you. 🔜📌

Developers are the unsung heroes of the digital age. We build the world, one line of code at a time. daily.dev.gnx is for developers, by developers. We understand the struggle.
